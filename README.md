# WD-CaseStudy

1. My website is going to be a personal website. It's purpose is to keep track of my girl scout stuff. The targeted audience is girls around my age that are interested in or participating in Girl Scouts, and my Girl Scout Troop. My website name will be 'My Troop Calendar'.

2. This website will help me keep track of wich badges we are on, cookie sale rates, and other activities/information we need to keep track of.

3. I will add pictures related to Girl Scouts and different kinds of badges, cookies, and activities we do. I don't know what music I could use, but definitely something  upbeat or happy. The main text and background colors will be green and white, with accent colrs such as purple or blue.

4. I expect to use pictures, colors, fonts, and maybe music or animation in my website. I will most likely try and set it up like a calendar, and have an area that we can use just to write information down on.

5. My website URL would be 'GSTroopCalendar.com'. It explains what my website is about, and is easy to remember.
